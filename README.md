ReFerID allows people to effortlessly retrieve product information using only a smartphone. Based on a easy-to-use Android app, dynamic NoSQL database, and NFC technologies which are becoming widely available in smartphones, RFID tags on valuable items can be quickly scanned for warranty information, user manuals, customer contact numbers and more. On the flipside, ReFerID enables companies to collect valuable market on when, where and who is using their products, allowing for the possibility of better customer service and promotions. As RFIDs are scanned, each reference is stored, providing a rich dataset of real-world interest in products.
